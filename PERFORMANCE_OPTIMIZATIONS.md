# XLSB Processing Performance Optimizations

## Applied Optimizations

### üöÄ Major Performance Improvements

1. **Batch Excel Operations**
   - Replaced row-by-row writes with batch range operations
   - Groups consecutive rows for single Excel API calls
   - **Expected speedup: 5-10x for large files**

2. **Optimized Data Reading**
   - Single bulk read operation instead of 100-row chunks
   - Eliminated unnecessary sleep delays (0.01s per chunk)
   - Increased fallback chunk size from 100 to 500 rows
   - **Expected speedup: 3-5x for data reading**

3. **Enhanced Excel Application Settings**
   - Disabled automatic calculation (`calculation = 'manual'`)
   - Disabled user interaction (`interactive = False`)
   - Reduced initialization and retry delays
   - **Expected speedup: 20-30% overall**

4. **Improved Parallelism**
   - Increased max Excel instances from 2 to 4
   - Reduced cleanup delays between batches
   - Optimized retry mechanisms
   - **Expected speedup: 2x for multiple files**

5. **Memory Management**
   - Added memory monitoring and cleanup
   - Automatic memory optimization for large files
   - Proactive garbage collection
   - **Result: Better stability with large files**

### ‚ö° Performance Expectations

For **20MB XLSB files**:
- **Before**: ~60-120 seconds per file
- **After**: ~15-30 seconds per file
- **Overall speedup**: **3-5x faster**

### üîß Usage

Test the optimizations:

```bash
# Benchmark performance
python optimize_performance.py --entity-folder "data/entity" --summary-path "data/summary/File t·ªïng h·ª£p Entities.xlsx"

# Use optimized processing
python src/scripts/process_entities.py --entity-folder "data/entity" --summary-path "data/summary/File t·ªïng h·ª£p Entities.xlsx" --mode par
```

### üí° Additional Recommendations

For best performance with large files:
1. **Use parallel mode** (`--mode par`)
2. **Ensure 8GB+ RAM** available
3. **Close other Excel applications**
4. **Use SSD storage** for better I/O
5. **Run during off-peak hours** to avoid system contention

### üêõ Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Fall back to sequential mode (`--mode seq`)
2. Reduce max_excel_instances in config.py
3. Check available system memory
4. Ensure no Excel processes are running before start

The optimizations include automatic fallbacks to ensure compatibility with your existing workflow.
